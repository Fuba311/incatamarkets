How to Use the INCATA Produce Flow Network Map
This guide explains how to read and interact with the "Produce Flow Network" map to understand tomato trade dynamics in Kenya.

Understanding the Map Elements 
The map visualizes the connection between tomato sources and the markets where they are sold. Each element on the map has a specific meaning:

ðŸ”´ Red Dots (Produce Origins): These represent the counties or regions where tomatoes are grown and sourced from. Hovering over a red dot shows which markets it supplies. Their location in the map is just an estimate, as in most cases the answer is an entire county, but without the exact location of the source.

ðŸ”µ Blue Dots (Markets): These are the specific markets included in the study. Hovering over a blue dot reveals detailed information, including its name, type, the total quantity of tomatoes traded, and a breakdown of its supply origins by percentage. We use the markets' precise coordinates.

Lines (Trade Routes): The lines connect a produce origin (red dot) to a market (blue dot). The color and thickness of the line indicate how important that origin is for that specific market.

Orange (Thick): High Share (>75%) - The origin is a primary source for the market.

Purple (Medium): Medium Share (25-75%) - The origin is a significant source.

Green (Thin): Low Share (<25%) - The origin is a minor source.

How to Interact with the Controls 
You can customize the map view using the various filters and toggles.

Select Season & Time Period:

Use the Season toggle (High / Low) and the Time Period slider (10 Yrs Ago / 5 Yrs Ago / Now) to see how trade networks have changed over time and between seasons.

Adjust Route Visibility:

Show Trade Routes: Uncheck this box to hide the colored lines and focus only on the market and origin locations.

Route Opacity: Use this slider to make the trade route lines more or less transparent, which can be helpful when viewing them over other map layers like roads or nightlights.

Customize Map Layers:

Use the Map Overlays checklist to add or remove contextual data:

Show Markets & Origins: Toggles the red and blue dots.

Show Roads: Overlays the road network for the selected time period.

Show Nightlights: Displays a heatmap of nighttime light intensity, which often correlates with economic activity and population density. This will change the map's base color to dark mode for better visibility.

Navigate the Map:

Zoom: Use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

Pan: Click and drag the map to move to different areas. The map view will remain in place even when you change filters.

Each selection will take a couple of seconds to load, as this is hosted on a free server which is very resource limited. Also, in most cases, when you enter the website you will have to wait at least a minute for the app to start and load, again this is due to the free server. Paid instances can be as low as 7$ or 25$ per month.
